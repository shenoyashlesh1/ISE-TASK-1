IoT Intelligent Food and Grain Storage Warehouse Management System
Project Overview

This project presents an IoT-based Intelligent Food and Grain Storage Warehouse Management System developed as part of the Introduction to Software Engineering (IS1103-1) course.

The system continuously monitors environmental conditions inside grain warehouses using IoT sensors and provides real-time alerts to prevent spoilage, fire hazards, gas accumulation, and unauthorized access.

It also includes a comparative study of three Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models:

Waterfall Model

Incremental Model

Spiral Model

The Spiral Model was identified as the most suitable model for this IoT-based system due to its strong risk management and iterative development approach.

Problem Statement

Traditional grain storage methods rely heavily on manual monitoring, which:

Is slow and unreliable

Fails to detect early warning signs

Leads to grain spoilage and economic losses

This project aims to design and analyze an automated IoT-based monitoring system that ensures safe storage conditions through real-time environmental monitoring and alert generation.

System Architecture

The system consists of:

Sensor Module – Collects environmental data

Microcontroller Module – Processes sensor inputs

Cloud Platform – Stores and visualizes data

User Interface – Displays dashboards and sends alerts

Data Collected

The system monitors:

Temperature
